Tracking and Testing Plan

2.
  A. Define your artifacts?
  Our artifacts will be defined based on the project requirements. Initially, artifacts will represent the primary functional requirements and the primary technical requirements for our project. Once the primary artifacts are completed, the next set of artifacts will consist of the secondary functional and technical requirements.
  
  B. Transparently record progress? (i.e. at any point in time, I or any of your teammates should be able to see how far along you are on each artifact.)
  The progress of completion for each artifact shall be updated each time a team member contributes to an artifact. Each artifact will encompass their own set of tasks. The number of completed tasks shall represent the overrall completetion percentage of that artifact. Thus, project progress will be transparent to the team members.
  
  C. Determine when something is done?
  D. Decide what each person is working on?
  E. How will you make sure everyone understands what everyone else is doing enough to jump in and help if necessary?
  F. How and how often will you evaluate your progress and reassess your plan?
 
3.
  Determine a test plan.
 A. It's not usually the role of a test plan to discuss unit testing, but you do need to determine and provide your process for handling unit tests.  Who will be responsible for verifying that all code is unit tested?  How often will the unit tests be verified?
 B. How will integration points be tested?  How will you make sure the java code can talk to the database?  How will you make sure the client can talk to the java code?
 C. What functionality of the service as a whole will you verify?  How will you verify it?  Who will do the verification?  How often?
