Tracking and Testing Plan

2.
  A. Define your artifacts?
  B. Transparently record progress? (i.e. at any point in time, I or any of your teammates should be able to see how far along you are on each artifact.)
  C. Determine when something is done?
We will determine that something is done when it is functional and there is a product that is releasable. The person performing the work and the person accepting the work have this common definition of done.
  D. Decide what each person is working on?
Based on the roles within the team, team members will take on tasks during each sprint that are related to their role. The scrum master will get an assessment of the skill set of each team member and make sure that tasks are assigned accordingly.
  E. How will you make sure everyone understands what everyone else is doing enough to jump in and help if necessary?
In order to keep all team members aware of all aspects of project development we will hold daily standup where we will discuss progress made on each task and what we plan to do in order to move forward on that task. We will also rotate coding responsibility so that everyone is familiar with the code base and will easily be able to jump in, in the event that another team member is blocked. We will also write very readable code and have commenting throughout that will help others understand the code base.
  F. How and how often will you evaluate your progress and reassess your plan?
 
3.
  Determine a test plan.
 A. It's not usually the role of a test plan to discuss unit testing, but you do need to determine and provide your process for handling unit tests.  Who will be responsible for verifying that all code is unit tested?  How often will the unit tests be verified?
 B. How will integration points be tested?  How will you make sure the java code can talk to the database?  How will you make sure the client can talk to the java code?
 C. What functionality of the service as a whole will you verify?  How will you verify it?  Who will do the verification?  How often?
