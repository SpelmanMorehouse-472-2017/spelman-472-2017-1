What's the purpose of the profile?  Think about how your users would use your service.  What info would they want to enter and when?  What might they want to vary on subsequent searches?

What's your database schema?

Why is the only thing in you API profile data?  What about all the college and salray data?

What happens in your UI when someone is entering data into a search?  Partial matches?  What happens if their search doesn't match anything?

What is a "region"?

What are you artifacts?  Where is the tracking doc?  Where are you tracking status and tests?  What is your API URL?  What is your final data source?  What will your client be - an HTML page?

Are you really having daily standups?  Should probably plan to update more than just on completion.  

Are you really supporting a bunch of cross-platform stuff?
Your usability requirements should probably be a little more specific than "funcitoning"
