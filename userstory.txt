Topic - Where It Pays To Go To College

Sydney is a high school senior at Riverdale High School in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Sydney attends a public school in inner city Philadelphia. The School District of Philadelphia is on the verge on bankruptcy. Superintendent William Hite has released the District’s new five-year plan, including significant new investments in schools and an internal turnaround strategy that relies on receiving a significant infusion of state aid –- a chancy prospect given the budget gridlock in Harrisburg.

While the five year plan is taking place, the district has implemented cut-backs. There has been less resources for students to receive for aiding in the College process. Riverdale HS is down to only one high school counselor. With a senior class size of 565 students, the counselor has little to no time for Sydney. 

Sydney wants to attend college, but with all the news of college graduates not receiving jobs upon graduation she wants help with choosing a major and shcool.
